  <h1><center>Personal Reflection</center></h1>
  <div id="first">Being the light of the world is a profound concept that resonates deeply with many people.
    <br>
    There are times when the darkness feels overwhelming, but I remind myself that even the smallest light can pierce the darkness. I draw strength from my faith, resilience, and the support of loved ones.
Being the light doesn't mean I'm immune to challenges, but it means I face them with courage, hope, and determination.
 
  <br>
    As I grow and learn, I aim to become a brighter, more compassionate, and more loving person. I recognize that being the light is a journey, not a destination.
I strive to be authentic, honest, and vulnerable, allowing my true self to shine through the imperfections. This vulnerability helps me connect with others on a deeper level.
    <br>
    By being one of the light of the world,I'm not just changing the world; I'm also transforming myself. I'm becoming more patient, empathetic, and understanding.
